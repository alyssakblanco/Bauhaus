      I color matched the two main colors in Hirschfeld-Mack's drawing and I found the difference between each color value.
      The color of his circle is (R=9, G=32, B=160) and I found the background to be (R+1, G+134, B-10).
      Every new pair of colors generated on click are that same exact distance apart.
      Also to mimic Hirschfeld-Mack's work, the scale has 12 steps and there are color-matched red lines across the footer
      to simulate the font-weight of the scribbled words.

      This image initially stood out to me on the Harvard Museums site because it reminded me of
      the first art classes I took while earning my bachelor's at UCF.
      Remembering learning about tints, shades, and all the other fun color theory principles inspired me
      to use the grayscale in the drawing to view the shades of the current color in focus (the circle). 
      I also liked Hirschfeld-Mack's use of the two complimenting colors and enjoy seeing how the parameters set by his choices 
      affect the randomly generated compliments.

      I had difficulty setting boundaries for the circle, to confine it within the inner background.
      I ended up putting margins on top for the circle to hide under, but my original plan
      was to always have the circle within the inner bounds.
      I would've liked to do something with the cut-out piece and plan to keep tinkering in the future.
